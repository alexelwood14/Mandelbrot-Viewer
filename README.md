## Movement: ##

accelerateForwards will increase the velocity of the baloon until it is at terminal velocity. 

`accelerateForwards()`

accelerateBackwards will decrease the velocity of the baloon until it is reversing at terminal velocity.

`accelerateBackwards()`

accelerateUp will increase the velocity of the baloon vertically until it is increaseing in altitude at terminal velocity.

`accelerateUp()`

accelerateDown will decrease the velocity of the baloon vertically until it is decreaseing in altitude at terminal velocity.

`accelerateDown()`

accelerateClockwise will increase the rotational velocity of the baloon in the clockwise direction until it is at terminal rotational velocity. 

`accelerateClockwise()`

accelerateAnticlockwise will increase the rotational velocity of the baloon in the anticlockwise direction until it is at terminal rotational velocity. 

`accelerateAnticlockwise()`
